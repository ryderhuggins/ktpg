TODO before sharing:
- unit tests
- integration test structure
- an example application using prepared statements and parsing the result
- Parse configuration from environment variables
- Change print statements to proper logging

New Features TODO
- Create a Connect function that just takes a connection string
- SSL/TLS (& channel binding for SASL/SCRAM)
- Proper native/KMP build setup - check here - https://dev.to/kotlin/how-to-build-and-publish-a-kotlin-multiplatform-library-creating-your-first-library-1bp8

Test TODOs
- calling a method on a closed connection
- incorrect password in startup flow
- what happens to connection if connection is terminated (e.g. database server dies)?

Refactoring/Improvements/Investments/Tech Debt
1. Refactor sendStartupMessagePassword to enable an API that could create an interactive terminal application (e.g. readAuthResponse)
2. SCRAM subsystem
    - better (more secure) random number generation for SCRAM clientFirstMessage
    - better understanding of gs2
    - !! read list of SCRAM mechanisms from server - it currently only reads one!!
3. Send simple query
    - Accommodate this: In simple Query mode, the format of retrieved values is always text, except when the given command is a FETCH from a cursor
