TODO before sharing:
- unit tests
- integration test structure
- an example application using prepared statements and parsing the result
- Change print statements to proper logging
- add a few more data types for prepared statement binding? 

Biggest missing features IMO
- SSL/TLS (& channel binding for SASL/SCRAM)
- more data types to be serialized in bind(...) calls
- handle binary format in response from server
- proper integration test setup

Other TODOs
- Create a Connect function that just takes a connection string
- Parse configuration from environment variables
- Proper native/KMP build setup - check here - https://dev.to/kotlin/how-to-build-and-publish-a-kotlin-multiplatform-library-creating-your-first-library-1bp8
- SCRAM stuff
    - better (more secure) random number generation for SCRAM clientFirstMessage
    - better understanding of gs2
    - !! read list of SCRAM mechanisms from server - it currently only reads one!!
- Refactor sendStartupMessagePassword to enable an API that could create an interactive terminal application (e.g. readAuthResponse)

Test TODOs
- calling a method on a closed connection
- incorrect password in startup flow
- what happens to connection if connection is terminated (e.g. database server dies)?
