Important gaps
- SSL/TLS (& channel binding for SASL/SCRAM)
- more data types to be serialized in bind(...) calls
    - also support binary serialization/deserialization - it's only text now
- proper integration test setup
- more unit tests
- remaining client commands: CancelRequest, FunctionCall, Copy among others
- proper logging

Other TODOs
- Create a Connect function that just takes a connection string
- Parse configuration from environment variables
- Proper native/KMP build setup -> hardcoded for my intel mac setup right now
- SCRAM stuff
    - better (more secure) random number generation for SCRAM clientFirstMessage
    - better understanding of gs2
    - !! read list of SCRAM mechanisms from server - it currently only reads one!!
- Refactor sendStartupMessagePassword to enable an API that could create an interactive terminal application (e.g. readAuthResponse)

Test TODOs
- calling a method on a closed connection
- incorrect password in startup flow
- what happens to connection if connection is terminated (e.g. database server dies)?
