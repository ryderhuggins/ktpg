**** Startup ****
Startup Message sent from client
Server will send one of: ErrorResponse, Authentication<Something>, NegotiateProtocolVersion

After having received AuthenticationOk, the frontend must wait for further messages from the server

Then the backend will send one or more of the following:
- BackendKeyData
- ParameterStatus
- ErrorResponse
- NoticeResponse
- ReadyForQuery -> this should be last in the list
