Current gameplan is to get "simple" query feature working, then go back and do cleanup, unit testing, and API surface area design

New Features
- Send simple query
    - Accommodate this: In simple Query mode, the format of retrieved values is always text, except when the given command is a FETCH from a cursor
- Change print statements to proper logging
- SSL/TLS (& channel binding for SASL/SCRAM)

Test TODOs
- calling a method on a closed connection

Refactoring/Improvements/Investments/Tech Debt
1. Refactor sendStartupMessagePassword to enable an API that could create an interactive terminal application (e.g. readAuthResponse)
2. SCRAM subsystem
    - refactor/cleanup and add in some tests
    - better (more secure?) random number generation for SCRAM clientFirstMessage
    - better understanding of gs2
    - read list of SCRAM mechanisms from server - it currently only reads one

Done
- Send simple query
    - proper ErrorResponse & NoticeResponse messages
    - handle return values from multiple statements in a simple query
- Send cleartext password response
- SCRAM:
    - SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication
