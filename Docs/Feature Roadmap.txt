New Features
- SCRAM subsystem
    - refactor/cleanup and add in some tests
    - better (more secure?) random number generation for SCRAM clientFirstMessage
    - better understanding of gs2
- Send simple query
- SSL/TLS (& channel binding for SASL/SCRAM)

Refactoring/Improvements/Investments/Tech Debt
1. REFACTOR TO MAKE USE OF SEALED CLASSES
2. Refactor sendStartupMessagePassword to enable an API that could create an interactive terminal application (e.g. readAuthResponse)
3. Fix the fact that the SASL Request from the server actually includes a list of mechanisms - not just 1

Done
- Send cleartext password response
- SCRAM:
    - PoC
    - SCRAM-SHA-256
