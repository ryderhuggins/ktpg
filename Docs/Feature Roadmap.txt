New Features
- Send simple query
- SSL/TLS (& channel binding for SASL/SCRAM)

Refactoring/Improvements/Investments/Tech Debt
1. Refactor sendStartupMessagePassword to enable an API that could create an interactive terminal application (e.g. readAuthResponse)
2. SCRAM subsystem
    - refactor/cleanup and add in some tests
    - better (more secure?) random number generation for SCRAM clientFirstMessage
    - better understanding of gs2
    - read list of SCRAM mechanisms from server - it currently only reads one

Done
- Send cleartext password response
- SCRAM:
    - PoC
    - SCRAM-SHA-256
